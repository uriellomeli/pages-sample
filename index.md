## Welcome!

At CSPV, I collaborate on different projects as part of the evaluation team and as a data analyst. I have a degree in Economics from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, a Master’s degree in Population Studies, and a Doctorate in Demography from The University of Texas at San Antonio. I also enjoy biking, hiking, reading non-fiction, going to movie matinees, and playing and watching fútbol.
